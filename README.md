## 🚀 Setup in 3 steps

### Step 1 — Install the ntfy app
- iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/ntfy/id1625396347)
- Android: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy)

Open the app → **Subscribe to topic** → enter a random topic name, e.g.:
```
afk-codes-x7k92mzp
```
> ⚠️ Use a hard-to-guess name so nobody else can read your notifications!

### Step 2 — Create a GitHub repo
1. Log in to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a new repo named `afk-code-tracker`
3. Upload all these files to the repo

### Step 3 — Add a GitHub Secret
Go to your repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** → add:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `NTFY_TOPIC` | The topic name you chose in Step 1 (e.g. `afk-codes-x7k92mzp`) |

Done! 🎉

## ▶️ Test run
Go to the **Actions** tab → **AFK Arena Code Tracker** → **Run workflow**

If new codes are found, you'll receive a notification on your phone right away!

## ⏰ Schedule
Runs automatically every **3 hours**, completely free.

## 🎟️ Auto-redeem codes (`redeem.py`)

The scraper only *tells* you about codes. `redeem.py` actually **claims every pending code for your server** in one go.

Logging in needs a **verification code that rotates every ~2 minutes** (generated in-game), so this step can't run unattended on the cron — you trigger it and paste a fresh code. Once logged in, the session lasts ~3 hours, so it redeems your codes at a polite pace.

```bash
# 0. Install dependencies into a virtual environment (first time only)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # re-run this line in any new terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. Find your numeric UID in-game (tap your profile)
export AFK_PLAYER_UID=<your_uid>
export AFK_SERVER=companions        # or "classic" (default: companions)

# 2. Run it, then paste a FRESH code at the prompt (Settings → Verification Code)
python redeem.py
```

You can also pass the code as an argument: `python redeem.py <verification_code>`.

A single login redeems **all** pending codes for the chosen server. AFK Arena's **Classic and Companions servers don't share codes**, so the script only tries codes tagged for your server (codes meant for the other server are detected and skipped). Each result is recorded in `known_codes.json` (`claimed` / `expired` / `invalid`) so the table above stays accurate and dead codes are never re-tried. Rewards arrive in your **in-game mailbox**.

> ⚠️ **Notes**
> - Uses the unofficial public endpoint `cdkey.lilith.com/api` and only ever touches **your own** account.
> - Store your UID as the `AFK_PLAYER_UID` GitHub Secret (or an env var). The verification code is passed per-run and never stored.
> - The API rate-limits rapid redeems, so the script paces itself (~4s/code) and backs off automatically — a full run takes a couple of minutes. Anything still rate-limited is left `pending`; just run again later.
> - **Run locally** — a GitHub Action's cold-start can blow the ~2-minute login window.
